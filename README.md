## About GlobalSpawn

Global spawn lets you set a default spawn for all players.
Unlike vanialla that spawn can even be in a separate dimension.
Useful for modpacks that start in the Nether or other dimensions. 

## Features

Configure the global spawn via:
- Config file
- Mod Menu
- or "/globalspawn" command
